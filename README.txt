I am also using Atom in this folder, and tsconfig.json was generated by Atom.

I will work on refactoring the code in this folder and also put it under git control.

Consider wrapping the Bezier curve in another class called edited Bezier curve that contains some state variables such as current parameter, whether a control point has been selected or whether the point on the curve has been selected and whether we are in animation mode or in explore with mouse mode.

The goal is to get rid of all the global variables.

We should also add header blocks to the TypeScript source code.

I have just created a Git repository for the files in this directory.  I also created a remote repository on GitHub, although I clicked the button to do that.  Let me check to see whether it has been created, and if so, whether there is one repository or two.

I see that I can Add untracked files to the repository, so I will add all except the derived file BusyBCurves.js.

So, I will be adding the following files to the repository via the Add item
	•	BusyBCurves.html
	•	BusyBCurves.ts
	•	BusyBCurvesHelp.html
	•	README.rtf (this file)
	•	tsconfig.json

I just logged in to Github and I do not see the repository BusyBCurves, even though I just thought that I added it by doing a push.  What is wrong?

I was able to create a new repository named BusyBCurves and then push the files from my computer to GitHub.

I am trying to use jsdoc but I noticed that the JavaScript generated from the TypeScript does not contain the specially-formatted jsdoc-style comments.

For now, I think we should just put in comments using my own style and not worry about jsdoc, since it seems not to be ready.  But I will continue to use the jsdoc style; I guess.

So that is what I am doing.

I am going to change this file to a plain text file.
